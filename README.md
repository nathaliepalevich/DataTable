# Frontend Engineer Home Assignment


## Introduction

Welcome to the Frontend Engineer Home Assignment! You will be building a powerful and user-friendly UI page that leverages the capabilities of the Ant Design Data Table while adding your own creative touch.



### `Assignment Overview`

Your task is to create a React project that utilizes the Ant Design package to build a dynamic data table component and integrate it into a UI page.
 The assignment is divided into several stages, including creating a custom data table component, 
 developing a UI page, adding column width resizing, 
 and implementing a bonus feature for column width persistence.



### `Getting Started`

To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

#### `Installation`

Clone the repository to your local machine:

**git clone https://github.com/nathaliepalevich/DataTable.git**

Navigate to the project directory:

**cd DataTable**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

**npm install**

#### `Running the Application`

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application. Make sure you are in the project directory

**npm start**

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000. You can access it in your web browser.

### `Features`

#### `Agora-DataTable Component`

The agora-datatable component is a custom component that builds upon the Ant Design Data Table.
It incorporates necessary styles for seamless integration into different UI pages.

#### `UI Page with Data Table`

The UI page features a dynamic data table with multiple columns of varying types (text, numbers, dates, etc.). It includes search filters to quickly find specific data and paging functionality for a smooth browsing experience.

#### `Column Width Resizing Feature`
The agora-datatable component includes a feature that allows users to resize column widths,
giving them control over column customization.

#### `Bonus: Column Width Persistence`

As a bonus feature, the project automatically saves and restores custom column widths even after page refresh.
This enhances the usability of the data table for returning users.

### `Misc`
* The project is built using React.
* Code quality and organization follow best practices.
* To submit your code, create a repository (e.g., on GitHub) and push your code there.
